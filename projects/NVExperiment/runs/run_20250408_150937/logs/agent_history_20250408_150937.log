[2025-04-08 15:09:39] USER: run a galvo scan
[2025-04-08 15:09:43] ASSISTANT: <think>
For a galvo scan, I should:
1. First read the default galvo scan configuration
2. Check if there are any existing scan results
3. Ask permission to run the scan with default settings
4. After running, analyze the results to identify NV centers

Let me start by reading the default configuration and informing the user.

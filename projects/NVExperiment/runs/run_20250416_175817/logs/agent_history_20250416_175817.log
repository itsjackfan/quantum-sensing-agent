[2025-04-16 17:58:26] USER: run a galvo scan and read the plot
[2025-04-16 17:58:30] ASSISTANT: <think>
I'll execute this in steps:
1. First read the default galvo scan config
2. Write a new config with default settings
3. Ask permission to run the galvo scan
4. After running, analyze the plot to find bright spots (NVs)
Let me start with reading the default config.

Since I was denied reading the default config from that path, I'll adjust to read from the correct path (configs/ instead of projects/configs/). Then I'll write the new config and ask to run the experiment.

I notice my previous path attempts were incorrect. I'll now run the galvo scan experiment using the correct project path structure as specified in the instructions. After this runs, I'll request to analyze the resulting plot.

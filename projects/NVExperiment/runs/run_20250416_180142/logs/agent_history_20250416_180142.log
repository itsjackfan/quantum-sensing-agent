[2025-04-16 18:01:47] USER: read a plot from the output data directory
[2025-04-16 18:01:53] ASSISTANT: <think>
I need to analyze the plot images from a previous experiment run. Since I don't know which specific run directory to look in, I should first ask the user for clarification about which run's data they want me to examine. I'll also ask which type of plot they want me to analyze since there could be different types (ESR_plot.png, FindNV_plot.png, GalvoScan_plot.png, or Optimization_plot.png).

[2025-04-16 18:02:06] USER: look in the current run directory, and analyse the galvoscan plot
[2025-04-16 18:02:13] ASSISTANT: <think>
I'll need to analyze the GalvoScan_plot.png from the current run directory. Since this is a galvo scan plot, I should look for bright dots that indicate NV centers and report their coordinates. I'll use the vision action to analyze the plot, and then provide feedback about what I observe.

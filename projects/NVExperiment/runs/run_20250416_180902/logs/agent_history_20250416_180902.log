[2025-04-16 18:09:06] USER: run a galvo scan
[2025-04-16 18:09:11] ASSISTANT: <think>
To run a galvo scan, I should:
1. First read the default galvo scan config
2. Create a new config based on default settings
3. Ask permission to write the new config
4. Ask permission to run the galvo scan
5. After running, I should analyze the results using vision
Let me start with reading the default config.

[2025-04-16 18:09:26] ASSISTANT: <think>
Since the user approved, I will:
1. Write a new galvo scan config with default parameters
2. Ask permission to run the experiment
I'll keep the scan parameters fairly standard for an initial scan to cover a reasonable area.

The user has approved running the galvo scan experiment. I will:
1. Execute the galvo scan script with the config we just created
2. After the experiment completes, I should analyze the results using the vision command to look for bright spots indicating NV centers
Let me start by running the experiment.

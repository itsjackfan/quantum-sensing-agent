[2025-04-16 18:16:06] ASSISTANT: <think>
I'll analyze the current run's plot data. Since we haven't run any experiments yet in this session, I should first check with the user about this and explain the situation.

[2025-04-16 18:16:13] USER: yes, then analyse the plot
[2025-04-16 18:16:17] ASSISTANT: <think>
I'll follow a step-by-step approach:
1. First read the default galvo scan config
2. Write a new config with default settings
3. Ask permission to run the galvo scan
4. After it completes, analyze the resulting plot
Let me start with reading the config.

[2025-04-16 18:16:24] ASSISTANT: <think>
Since I couldn't read the default config file (path issue), I'll create a basic galvo scan config with standard parameters that are typically used for initial scans. After writing the config, I'll ask permission to run the experiment.

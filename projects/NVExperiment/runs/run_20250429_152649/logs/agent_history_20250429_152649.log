[2025-04-29 15:26:58] ASSISTANT: <think>
To run an NV experiment, we should follow a logical sequence:
1. First, we need to do a galvo scan to locate NVs in the field of view
2. Start by reading the default galvo scan config
3. Create a modified config and run the galvo scan
4. After that, we can analyze the results and proceed with further steps

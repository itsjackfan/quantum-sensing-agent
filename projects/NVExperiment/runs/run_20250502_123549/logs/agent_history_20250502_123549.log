I'll help run a galvo scan experiment. The process should be:
1. First read the default galvo scan config
2. Write a new config file with any necessary adjustments
3. Ask permission to run the galvo scan
4. After running, we'll want to analyze the results using vision
Let me start with reading the default config.

Since this is a request about past experiments, I should:
1. Check for any previous galvo scan results or configurations in our run history
2. If I find any, analyze them to understand what settings were used
3. Summarize this information for the user
4. If no history is found, inform the user we'll need to start with default settings

Let me first try to read the default config to establish a baseline.

I need to carefully review the provided context, but I notice that the context snippets shared are quite limited and don't contain specific galvo scan settings. Let me be transparent about this limitation and suggest a path forward.

1. The context only shows fragments about ESR configs and a previous attempt to run galvo scan
2. I don't have access to complete historical settings
3. Best course of action would be to:
   a) Acknowledge the limitation
   b) Request user guidance on typical settings they prefer
   c) Or suggest starting with default settings if available
</think>

From the provided context, I can see fragments suggesting we've worked with default configs before, but I should verify this by:
1. Reading the default galvo scan config file properly (noting my previous attempts failed due to incorrect path format)
2. Being explicit about the limitations of my context knowledge
3. Taking a step-by-step approach as requested
